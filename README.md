This project was completed for the purpose of creating a portfolio page for my personal web development projects. It is important for web developers to have a portfolio page as it showcases their projects and skills with respect to web development. I consider this initial version of my portfolio as a "first draft" and plan on updating it regularly as I develop my web development skills and create various web applications.
