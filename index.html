    <img src="assets/prof_pic.jfif" alt="">
    <p>My name is Greg Pfeifer and I am an aspiring web developer! I graduated from
        Rutgers University in 2018 with a B.A. in Economics and began working at a 
        mortgage company as a loan underwriter. After five years in this industry,
        I decided I want to pursue a career in information technology, a subject that
        has always fascinated me. My goal is to become proficient with all the tools
        available to a web developer and pursue an entry-level position upon completion
        of this course.
        <br>
        <br>
        In my free time, I like to work out and play drums and guitar. I also love to
        read; Stephen King is perhaps one of my favorite authors!
